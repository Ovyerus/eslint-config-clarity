# eslint-config-clarity

> Collection of ESLint configs to ensure code consistency and clarity!

<!-- TODO: mention the patch -->

## Installation

To install this into your project, you'll need to install the main package,
along with all of its peer dependencies.

As of `npm@7`, you can simply run `npm i --save-dev eslint-config-clarity` and
it will install the package as well as its peer dependencies for you.

Else if you have **npm** version 5 or above, you can simply run the following
command, for either npm or yarn:

```
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-clarity
```

After installing the config and required packages, simply add
`"extends": "clarity"` to your .eslintrc, or specify the name of one of the
presets depending on the project.

## Integrations

It is recommended to copy the [`.vscode`](./.vscode) (if using
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig),
and [`.prettierrc`](./.prettierrc) to your project's directory, and also install
the extensions recommended in
[`.vscode/extensions.json`](./.vscode/extensions.json).

The VSCode settings will enable ESLint for JavaScript and TypeScript files, and
sets Prettier as the default formatter for several filetypes, as well as
enabling auto-fix and auto-formatting on save.

If you're not using VSCode as your code editor, it is recommended that you find
equivalent plugins and settings for your editor of choice.

## Presets

These are the recommended configurations to use as they combine the
[base presets](#base-presets) together with themselves and other ESLint settings
to provide reasonable defaults.

- [clarity](./index.js) The default configuration provided by this package, for
  use with any regular JavaScript project.
- [clarity/react](./react.js) Configuration for use with any JavaScript + React
  project.
- [clarity/vue](./vue.js) Configuration for use with any JavaScript + Vue
  project.
- [clarity/typescript](./typescript.js) Configuration for use with any regular
  TypeScript project.
- [clarity/react-typescript](./react-typescript.js) Configuration for use with
  any TypeScript + React project.
- [clarity/vue-typescript](./vue-typescript.js) Configuration for use with any
  TypeScript + Vue project.

## Base Presets

These are ESLint configurations which contain only the rules intended for that
particular use case, plus any bare needs for it to function on its own (for
example, a parser neded for it to work). It is recommended to use the regular
[presets](#presets), however there may be cases in which you need to customise
special functionality for the rules, in which case you'd use these.

- [clarity/base](./base.js) The default base configuration. Provides rules for
  general JavaScript projects.
- [clarity/react-base](./react-base.js) Base configuration that provides rules
  for React and React Hooks.
- [clarity/vue-base](./vue-base.js) Base configuration that provides rules for
  Vue files & components.
- [clarity/typescript-base](./typescript-base.js) Base configuration that
  provides rules for TypeScript files. Intended to also be used in conjunction
  with the default base configuration.
